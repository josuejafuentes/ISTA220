1. What is a compound assignment operator? How does it work?
  is an easier way of adding value to a variable
2. List all the compound assignment operators.
  +=,-=,*=,/=,&=
3. List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by
50

  type variable = value + 5;
type variable += 5;

  type variable = value - 50;
 type variable -= 50;

4. How long does a while loop run?
until a certain condition is met
5. What is an iteratiion variable? (Not in book)
a statement that repeats itself until a condition is met
6. What happens if you don't change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?
it wont run
7. How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any of them? Can you omit all of
them? What happens if you omit all of them?
is composed of three parts initial statement, loop statement, and update control variable
you can omit all of them different stuff happens if you omit the loop statement itll become an
infinite loop if you omit the initial statement it wont run if you omit the update itll jump
to the next statement
8. How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?
by using the break and continue commands
9. What does the break statement do?
it breaks away from the loop and to the next statement
10. What does the continue statement do?
it continues to the next statement after the loop is over
11. (Thought question) Can you think of any reason why you would want to have an innite loop? An
\innite loop" is a loop without an update variable that in eect runs forever. As you will see, these
kinds of loops are written intentionally to perform various kinds of tasks.
it could work well to make a clock app or maybe a gif
